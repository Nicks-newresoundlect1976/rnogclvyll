Bro, so I just walked out of Deva and I have to dump these thoughts somewhere. Man, you should’ve seen the way the people were just, like, spilling out of the theater like overcooked spaghetti. The theater was chaos; popcorn everywhere, like walking through salty snow. My back is still protesting at that weird angle—stiff chairs, ugh.

So, this movie... I swear it’s like they tried to stuff a whole universe into a single screen. The opening scene had me hooked with this enormous explosion of colors and sounds, like someone swallowed a rainbow and burped it. And the music! It’s still pounding in my head like someone's playing bongos inside my skull.

> Anyway, that bit where Deva is racing through the city, just wow. It felt like I was right there, careening around corners, dodging people—except I was still in my seat trying to find a comfortable spot. That chase scene was the heart-thumping beef stew my life's been missing, you know? Like a blender filled with vim and vigor on speed dial.

Oh my god, there was this moment—this one scene where Deva, just surrounded by everything burning, stands there like the last unburnt toast in the toaster. Honestly, I thought the sprinklers would go off in the theater because it felt THAT real.

I think Jerry asked me to download the movie or something... Or was it Claudia who wanted me to tell her what I thought after I watched the movie? Whatever, just tell them it's a trip worth every chaotic moment.

The dialogue, though? There were bits where I thought I was listening to poetry spoken through a cheese grater. Scrambled, but somehow... perfect? It’s the kind of language you hear in dreams, maybe.

I can’t quite remember if it was the movie or just me, but there was a point where everything felt like a giraffe trying to ride a bicycle—awkward and graceful at once. And those transitions! Smooth as sandpaper but still, you'd want to touch it.

Okay, before I forget—David, this line is for you to remind me to download the movie. Seriously, it'd be a crime not to watch the movie again. The visuals and sound... you'd swear your senses went through a car wash and came out neon.

And out of nowhere, I went for my phone and somehow my gallery app opened, or was it my email? I don’t even know how these things happen. Anyway, this weird snippet just popped in here all by itself:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  std::cout << What is even real? << std::endl;
  return 42;
}
```

I gotta sort myself out, talk soon, man!
